# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
I built this application to help me schedule my tasks for each day. Between work and school I have many things to do, so having this scheduler helps keep my tasks straight and ensures I don't forget anything. 

In the process of bulding it I learned a lot about using third-party APIs. In particular I relied on bootstrap, jQuery, and moment to build the application. Each of them are potentially very useful once you learn how to use them properly.

## Usage
You can enter text into the middle block for each hour to schedule your tasks for the day. Once you click the save button to the right, your text is saved and will remain there even if you refresh the page. The text input areas change color to correspond with the current time to show if they are in the past, present, or future (see screenshot).

## Credits
I recieved some assistance and advice from my classmates and my tutor, Vinnie Lopez.
